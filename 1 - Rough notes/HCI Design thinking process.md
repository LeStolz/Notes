# Process
- There must be iteration.
- User empathization -> Problem definition -> Design -> Prototype -> Evaluation
- Investigate -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Evaluate -> Go back | Produce:
	1. Investigate: 
		- Discover stakeholders, goals, needs.
		- How is it done now?
		- What is wanted?
		- What has been tried?
	2. Ideate:

		- Identify challenges
		- Uncover subtleties
	4. Evaluate:
		- Discover problems
		- Assess progress
		- Determine next step
	5. Produce:
		- Build final product
		- Marketing, support and maintenance
- Some design processes:
	- Buxton’s Design Process
	- Idea Generation Process: Ideas -selection/iteration-> concept selection
