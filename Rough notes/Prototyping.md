# Purpose
### Explore the design space
- Quantity over quality.
- Parallel prototyping over serial prototyping.
- Comparison over separation.
- Avoid the danger of critiquing one idea.
- Give a quick impression of the design idea before implementing
### Deal with things that are hard to predict + Communicate 
- Less time, more informative.

## Measures
- User interaction.
- User time.
- Expert's rating.
# Choosing a prototyping method
## Manage risk
- Start with what you know the least about
- Formulate question(s) you need answered
- Choose a method that's "maximum feedback for minimum effort"
- Every prototyping method has strengths and weaknesses
- Digest what you’ve learned, make changes
- Move on to the next thing you’re worried about
## Start with your questions
- Does this work flow support the business goals?
- Why do people say they can’t find things? 
- How much flexibility do users need?
- Or specific questions.
## The rights of a prototype
- Should not be required to be complete
- Should be easy to change
- Gets to retire
# Techniques
![[Prototyping Techniques.png]]
## Scenario
- Scenarios are stories about people and their activities.
- Text paragraph, Storyboard, Video.
- Elements: Agents / Actors, Setting, Goals / Objectives, Actions / Events, Artifacts
### Storyboarding
- Quick Versatile Powerful for Usability Engineering
- Include key frames: caption + drawing
- Forget the details: Thick markets, limit space, time yourself
- Get many alternatives instead of one
- Transform into Digital Form when done
#### Procedure
- Decide What to Include: Same as scenario + system. As little text as possible
- Build the Storyboard
- Feedback & Iteration
## Sketching
- ***Sketch first***
- Rough, Fast, Timely, Cheap.
- Should not take more than 3 minutes
- Should not use more than pen and paper
- Separating design from the process of making.
- Sketch out: Scenarios, flow, pages of functionalities, text description.
## Paper prototyping
- The paper model of your design.
- A key component of the DESIGN process.
- Low Cost Collaborative Fast Iteration
- Tools: 
	- Paper, Cardboard, Transparencies,
	- Tape, Glue, Rubber Cement
	- Pens, Pencils, Markers
	- Scissors
	- Plastic Tubes, Paper Cups, CD “Coasters”
	- Anything that you can buy in an arts and crafts store
## Hybrid prototypes
- Software/Hardware + paper.
- PowerPoint prototyping
## Wizard of Oz
- An operator plays the role of “computer” and enters data “behind the scenes”
- Test the concept of an idea without actual implementation.
- Often combined with mock-ups, paper prototypes and partially functional prototypes.
