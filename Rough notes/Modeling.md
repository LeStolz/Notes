# Pipeline
1. Define geometry and position in local coordinates.
2. Transform (scale, rotation) in local coordinates.
3. Transform (position) in global coordinates.
4. Transform (express) everything from the POV of the camera.
5. Transform (project) 3D coordinates from camera space to 2D screen space.
6. We could always apply geometric enhancement in any step.
