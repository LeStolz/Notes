#Extended-Reality

> Combine the real world and the virtual one
> To improve, complete, restore, predict reality by a computer
> By providing natural sensory assistance/extension to the user
> Thus, must be in real-time

# Fundamental rules of AR
Interaction between the real world and the virtual one.
Real-time.
Sensory coherence between the 2 worlds. This is done using:
- Estimation of the camera's pose (transform).
- Vision based methods: sensible to mobility, luminosity, occlusion,...
# Augmentations

## Optical see-through

## Video see-through

## Screen

## Position tracker
- Inertia center.
- Ultrasound tracker.
- Camera.
- Magnetic trackers.
- GPS.
# Applications
Medicine, maintenance, entertainment, military.
# AR system
- High level: Interaction, Presentation, Authoring.
- Low level: Rendering, Displaying technology, Tracking and Calibrating.
## Problems
### [[Recognition and 3D Registering]]
