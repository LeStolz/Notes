## Senses
To sense changes/information. Includes:
- Sight (important): 
	- POV of 200 deg, HD POV of 15 deg
	- 120M Rods to perceive B/W. 1000x more sensitive than cones
	- 6-7M Cones: 64% R, 32% G, 2% B
	- 7-8% of males and 0.4% of females cannot distinguish red from green
	- Peripheral vision (movement oriented) of 180 deg
	- Stereopsis:
		- Monocular (color, brightness, shape)
		- Binocular (size, interposition, perspective, parallax)
- Hearing (important):
	- 20 - 20K Hz. 30 - 100dB. 5° source & stream separation.
	- Timbre – type of sound (music instruments).
- Touch (important):
	- Pressure, Intense pressure, Temperature
	- Sensitivity, Dexterity, Flexibility, Speed
- Smell, tastes, kinesthetic
Senses constrain design space
## Cognition
To process and interpret input. Includes:
- Attention: Selected, Focused, Divided
- Memory:
	- Short-term: Small ~7 items (chunks) for ~10 seconds.
	- Repeating helps retain chunks. Distraction does the opposite.
	- Long-term: Unlimited. Elaborative rehearsal transfers chunks from short to long (learning).
	- Chunk depends on how the info is presented and what is known from experience.
	- Recognition vs Recall: Design for recognition.
## Motor System
React to input and cognition, characterized by Range of movement, speed, strength, dexterity, accuracy.
*=> Feedback is important, Minimize eye movement, Consider reachability,...*
# Usability
How well users can use it for what it was designed for: Learnability (Ease of understanding), Efficacity (The user succeeds in using the system like desired), Efficiency, Memorability, Errors often? easy to recover?, Satisfaction.

Measures: Retention over time, Subjective satisfaction, Rate of errors by users, Speed of performance, Time to learn.

Good usability: Visibility, Accessibility, Consistency, Affordances (Perceived and actual properties give clues to its operation).

UX vs. Usability: Understandability vs. Holistic design.
Usability vs. Usefulness: Understandability vs. Capacity to provide users with what they need to accomplish a task.
Function vs. Usage: Sometimes, Less is more!

Ergonomics = Usability + Usefulness
# Mental models
> You know something won't work because you form a conceptual model of the device and mentally simulate its operations

- Internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made
- Involves unconscious and conscious processes: images and analogies are activated
- Deep versus shallow models: how to drive a car and how it works.
- Users develop an understanding of a system through learning and using it -> mental model:
	- How to use (what to do next)?
	- What to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works)
- People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks
- **Designs should not confuse/conflict users’ mental model**
# Metaphors
- visuals, actions and procedures that exploit knowledge that users have of other domains (physical objects).
- Objective: Give instantaneous knowledge about how to interact
# Conceptual model
- The mental model of how something should be done:
	- Core activities
	- Objects
	- Interface metaphors
- FORMULATING A CONCEPTUAL MODEL: 
	- What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks? 
	- How will the system support these? 
	- What kind of interface metaphor? 
	- What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use
