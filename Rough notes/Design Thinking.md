#HCI 

> Activity that seeks to change existing situations into preferred ones.

# Bad Designs
Techno-centered design is bad because everyone is different => User-centered design.
Bad:
- Assumption that users are all good at tech.
- High training cost.
- High maintenance cost.
- Loss of productivity (user uses better shortcut).
- Incomplete usage (design that users don't notice).
- Annotation.
- Loss of credibility.
- Poor [[The H in HCI|Usability]].

> The main reason for resistance to new tech is because of the incompatibility between the product, task, and the user.
# Design Thinking Process
> There must be iteration.

Apple's process:
1. [[User Research|Investigate]] | [[User Research Interpretation|Interpret]] (User empathization | Problem space): Discover stakeholders. How is it done now? What is wanted? What has been tried?
2. [[Brainstorming|Ideate]] (Solution space): Brainstorm, Grasp issues and potential solutions.
3. [[Prototyping|Prototype]]: Tangible. Identify challenges, Uncover subtleties
4. [[Prototyping Evaluation|Evaluate]]: Discover problems, Assess progress. Determine next step
5. Back to step 1 or 2 | Produce: Build final product. Marketing, support and maintenance

Other processes:
- Idea Generation Process: Ideas -selection/iteration-> concept selection
