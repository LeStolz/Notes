# Unsupervised
Grouping, finding structures
1 algorithm: Find nearest 2 points, replace them with their average, continue.

# Reinforcement
Agent -action-> environment ; environment -reward-> agent.
Balance between exploring new solution and using memory.
1 algorithm: Echelon
# Supervised
Labeled, predict target $y$ from features $x$.
