# Goal
- To fix or discard ASAP.
- Metrics: [[Quantitative Evaluation|Quantitative]] [[Qualitative Evaluation|Qualitative]] Objective Subjective
- To check if your design meets: Time, Money, Happiness requirements:
	- Productive, error-free, safe
	- Good public image
	- Repeat customers
- Expected Outcome: Work? Why? Why not?
# Look for these in evaluation
- Interface flaws: Confusing, misleading, inefficient interaction flow.
- Missed opportunities: functionalities users can’t find or don’t use as intended.
- Conformity to standards
# Two general evaluation approaches
## Formative testing
- Early stage of development
- Exploratory
- More focused on general design choices
- More qualitative
## Summative testing
- Later stage of development
- More focused on specific interface items
- More quantitative
- Goal-oriented
## *No clear dividing line between them* 
# Evaluation methods
- Inquiry-based: interviews, questionnaires
- Based on user observation: usability testing, communicability evaluation
- Expert-based (inspection, walkthroughs, potential problems): heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough
- (semi-)automated: eye-tracking, conformance to accessibility
## Interview & Questionnaires
- Be Curious!
- Avoid Leading Questions!
## Usability Testing
- Process of testing and proving a specific interface
- Watch & Record the test for later observations.
- Problem noted to be fixed later
- The user is NOT tested (users can never fail)
![[Usability Testing.png]]
- Many ways to do usability testing
	- Very structured: 100 users, videotaped, quantitative
	- Very unstructured: A few users, sitting next to evaluator, talk about what they like and don’t like
- Prototypes can be functional ones or “Wizard-of-Oz”
![[Usability Testing vs Experiment.png]]
## Quantitative Metrics
- Task, time performance
- User satisfaction (surveys, questionnaires)
- Error rate
- Time to learn
## Questions in questionnaires
- Likert scale question: Typically a five, seven or nine point agreement scale used to measure respondents’ agreement with a variety of statements.
- Ranking questions for experiments comparing different interfaces.: \_\_#1 \_\_#2 \_\_#3
- Open-ended questions: users freely comment about their experience
