# Purpose
- Who are your users.
- Their ethnography.
- Their goals, tasks.
- Their environments.
- Their tools.
- How they perform their tasks.
- Any hacks?
Our goal is a multi-faceted understanding on users & their goals, tasks, capabilities, constraints, strengths, weaknesses, limitations and problems.
# Methods
![[Pasted image 20240320092900.png]]
## Relying on what users say they want
### Their words are unreliable.
- It's better to watch/prototype than hear. Mismatches hold keys to new designs.
### They are however
- Good at responding to real things or making comparisons.
- Good at telling what they are doing, feeling and their goal **right now**.
## Observation: Look at what they REALLY do
- We can "see": 
	- The user's everyday task in their environment.
	- Hacks, Breakdowns, unexpected uses => Opportunity for new designs.
	- Mismatches between what they say and do.
- What we pay attention to:
	- How is space adapted to the job.
	- Actors, activities, acts, objects, hacks.
	- Key constraints.
	- Event/Triggers.
	- Time, goals, feelings.
	- Strategic decisions, tactical decisions.
### Fly on the wall
- Observe and record within it context without interference => See what is done in real context.
### Guided tour
- Accompany participants on a guided tour of spaces and activies they do => Exploration of objects, actions, intentions, values.
### Still photo survey
- Capture pictures of specific objects, activities => Evidence for patterns of behaviors and perceptions
### Activities analysis
- List all tasks, actions, objects, performers, and interactions in a process => Identify and prioritize who to interview as well as identifying which issues to address.
### Social network mapping
- Note different kinds of social relationships and their interaction network in a group => Understanding of interpersonal and professional relationships in a group.
### Timelapse
- Record in an area over a long period => Objective, Activities in a context.
### Behavioral Archeology
- Look for evidence of activities in the placement, wear patterns and organisations of places and things => How artifacts and environments figure a user's life => lifestyle, habits, priorities.
### A day in the life
- Catalog the activities and contexts that users experience throughout a day. => Unanticipated issues inherent in the routine.
### Shadowing
- Tag along with people to understand their routines, interactions, and contexts => Design opportunities, show how a product can help.
### Personal inventory
- Document what the user identify as important => lifestyle, activities, perceptions, values, patterns.
### Rapid Ethnography
- Visit/participate in their natural habitat and witness specific activities => deep understanding of habits, rituals, language, and meaning around activies and artifacts.
## Interview
- To get their motivations, thought process, hidden motives.
- Takes less time than looking.
- To ask hypothetical questions.
### Unfocus group
- Get a diverse group of people in a workshop and create things relevant to the project => Creative and divergent contributions from users + new thinking.
### Camera journal
- Ask users to keep a written and visual diary => POV, patterns.
### Cognitive map
- Ask users to map a place and ask how they navigate it => Discover significant elements, pathways and spatial behaviors.
### Culture probe
- Give camera kit to many cultures => Perceptions and behaviors across cultures.
### Foregin correspondents
- Cross-culture study to derive international design principles => Varied context on how the product is used.
### Narration
- When they are doing sth, ask them what they are thinking => Motivations, concerns, reasoning.
### Extreme user interviews
- Identify users who are extremely familiar or unfamiliar with the product and ask them to evaluate => Key issues, insights for improvement.
### 5 why
- Ask why 5 times => Underlying reason for behaviors
### Survey
- Ask a series of questions => Characteristics + Perception.
#### How to ask
- Relate to the user
- Tell them to teach me
## Try & Learn
### Roleplaying
- Identify stakeholders to roleplay as => Empathy + Raise issues.
### Try it yourself
- Use it => Empathy
### Informance
- Act out a scenario by roleplaying behaviors you have witnessed or researched => To communicate an insight to build a shared understanding of a concept.
## Second Study
### Persona
- Observe real people and create characters to represent their archetypes, behaviors, lifestyles => Communicate the value of different concepts to various target groups.
