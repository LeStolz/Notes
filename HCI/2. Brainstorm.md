# Brainstorming
## Creativity and Dissent
- Authentic dissenters – people who really disagree with group – can enhance group creativity.
- Their opinion needn’t be right – but they can free the group from stagnant thinking.
- The originality of the minority stimulates the majority
- Dissent is weakened if dissent is not real and is deliberate or is not encouraged.
