#Extended-Reality 

# [[History of Virtual Reality]]

# Objective
A *VR Engine* constructs a virtual environment with virtual elements and characters using *VR models* from software and databases (offline) which *acts/reacts to human's interaction like reality (not just a "potentially possible" reality) (INTERACTIVE)* in *REAL-TIME (online)* by *sending realistic (as natural as possible) multi-sensor-motor signals (IMMERSIVE)* to the user while they perform [[VR Tasks]] such that they believe they are a part of a real environment (immersed):
- Visuals (screen)
- Haptics, Manual (interact with the world via trackers,...)
- Vestibular
- Auditory (audio)
- Smells and tastes
The system is limited by its I/O devices and the nature of the app.
Thus, we must know human sensory system and have powerful computers... Not yet but...

Perception-Cognition-Action Loop.

The VR Model consists of realistic *static* models.
The VR Engine consists of realistic dynamic Geometry, Physics, Cinematic constraints, Acoustics, Segmentation, Interpretation of I/O, all in *real-time*. 

Real-time means updating faster than human reaction (ne perceivable delay between action and response), thus working with simplifications of architectures and algorithms in order to provide *immersion*.

2 important components of VR are the HC-Interface and the software of these interactions: Sensory interfaces (output of VR), Motor, Command interfaces (input of VR), Sensor-motor interfaces.
# Immersion
Total immersion: User and their body feels like in virtual scene.
Partial immersion: Watch the scene through a window but can interact with hands or tools.
Physical immersion: How much the VE surrounds you.
Psychological immersion: How much you feels "present" in the VE.

*VR immersion*: Objective and *measurable* level of sensory fidelity, factors:
- Modalities used, tracked body parts,
- Occlusion of real world,
- Natural, no learning,
- Small latency (visuellement << 50ms):
	- Vestibulo-ocular reflex << 30ms.
	- Hand movement perception < 100ms.
	- Comfortable head movement < 200ms.
	- Manual control < 250ms.
	- Limit of motion sickness,... < 300ms.
	- => Optimize, or train users, predict their actions.

In general, we expect:
- A true conviviality in the [[Human-Computer Interaction]] relationship.
- An increase in quality/reliability of simulation, design, and control of system.
- Ability to master more complex systems than those handled by conventional means.
## Pseudo-natural Immersion
Due to sensor-motor biases, we can't be completely natural in VE.
In VR, we re-exploit real-world behaviors => *Schemes*: Mental organisation of of actions for classes of situations => Unconscious without much effort.
Example: Grabbing object in VR, not totally natural because no weight, not tangible.
# Presence
Immersion => Presence <= 3 illusions: Place, Plausibility, Embodiment.
Subjective, context-dependant.
