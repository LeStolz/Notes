#Extended-Reality 

> VR is a generic technology: Can be used anywhere we need a graphical simulation (17%) to simulate better to be better used for training, teaching (16%), understanding, designing, managing, entertaining (21%), communicating (11%), controlling,...

# Training
## Advantages
- Immersion => Engagement.
- Learn by doing => Practical.
- Simulate dangerous scenarios => Safe.
- Easily adaptable => Cheap, flexible, less time-consuming.
- Immediate feedback.
## Disadvantages
- Skill not transferable.
- Virtual scenario not equivalent to real ones.
- Visual fatigue, cybersickness.
- Technology-dependent or deviation of educational objective.
# Prototyping
## Advantages
- Immersive visualisation.
- Reduce time and cost.
- Collaboration.
- Early ergonomic and aesthetic evaluation.
- Innovation.
## Disadvantages
- Pirating.
- Mal-interpretation of the virtual prototype (not the same as the real one).
- Simulation not correct (realistic) because technology-dependent.
- Expensive initial cost for the chain of prototyping.
# Domains
- Health:
	- Training by simulation (surgeon, dentist training with force feedback, medical situations). 
	- Research (3D Reconstitution for studying diseases, operation planning/guiding).
	- Therapeutic (patients are exposed to their fears safely).
	- Rehabilitation (gamification, therapy by sport).
	- Cognitive therapy.
	- Study sport gestures of professionals.
- Military: 
	- Training by simulation (vehicle, combat, weapon).
	- Management, supervision of operations.
- Construction et urbanisme:
	- Information, visits (maybe before construction to find errors)
	- Environmental studies, transport visualization, management.
- Training:
	- Technical gestures (fire extinguisher, painting, sawing, sculpting, flying, driving, operating).
- Culture:
	- Game
	- Virtual visits
	- Creating, diffusion
- Science and research:
	- Visualization and analysis of complex data (aerodynamics).
	- Exploration of phenomena (biology).
	- Teaching, diffusion.
- Collaboration:
	- Online working, collaborating
	- Metaverse (social network).
- Industry:
	- Marketing (virtual simulation of market layout, product, raising awareness).
	- Project preview (to fix technical/usability errors)
	- Design, art design.
	- Engineering (see mechanical parts of car)
	- Ergonomics simulation, production
	- Production (assembly line, human-robot collaboration).
	- Simulation (training, driving sim).
	- Maintenance (show where parts are, what to do).
	- Remote operating.
