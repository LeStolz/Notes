#HCI 

# Human-Human Interaction
> Simple

Same language, comprehensive production and search of feedback, can demand clarification, easily detect ambiguity and incoherence, corrective exchanges, meta-communicate.
# Human-Computer Interaction
> A lot more complicated

A multidisciplinary field (Art, CS, Business, Social, Engineering, Informatics, Ergonomics, Cognitive psychology, Technical writing, Math) of study focusing on the design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive technology for humans and the phenomena related to the HCI:
- Why?: Optimize user effort (efficient), lower barrier of entry (intuitive), joyful.
- How?: Envision and realize future HCI.
- Subfields: H-Robot-I, H-AI-I, H-Building-I, Animal-C-I.

The core of HCI is the [[The H in HCI|Human]] and the [[Design Thinking]] process.
# Human-Computer Interface
Hardware and software devices allowing a user to *interact* with an *interactive* system.
